# rubiks-cube-solver

During the project, I learned how to take a real-world object, like a Rubik’s Cube, and model it into something that a computer can understand. I learned how to break down a larger problem, like the complete Rubik’s Cube solver, into smaller problems using basic models and controllers, such as Rubik’s cube representations and solvers.

I also learned how to break down multiple representations into classes and create base classes that can be further extended, such as creating a Rubik’s Cube base class and a Pattern Database Base class.

Additionally, I learned many practical examples of Object-Oriented Programming in use, including classes and objects, virtual functions and abstract classes, inheritance, and operator overloading. I also learned how pathfinding algorithms like BFS, DFS, IDDFS, and IDA* can be used to solve real-world problems related to AI and how many more problems in the field of AI can be solved using these algorithms.

Finally, I learned about the concept of Heuristic Search Algorithms like A* and IDA* and how Pattern Databases can be created to provide that heuristic.
